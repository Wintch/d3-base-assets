 * Some models and most animations
 
 * A lot of bug fixing/testing is required
 
 * Working dedicated server
 
 * DPmaster will be developed in separate project
 
 * OpenGL Shaders to replace the stuff from Doom3's glprogs/ directory
   (maybe one of the GLSL implementations + shaders could be improved)

 * Music is missing, listen to http://dnbradio.com instead :)

Everything in this SDK should be under a free license that also allows commercial
use, e.g. WTFPL (http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/), a BSD-like license or a permissive
CC License (e.g. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US).
GPL may also be ok, but I'm trying to avoid that to make using the included assets
easier for projects that use other non-free assets.
