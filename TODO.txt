 * Some models and most animations must be rewritten to avoid Doom3 EULA
 
 * A lot of testing is required (cross platform as an example)
 
 * Dedicated server is not working and therefore binary is not provided (you can compile it at any time)
 
 * DPmaster will be developed in separate project, not working yet
 
 * OpenGL ARB programs to replace the ones from Doom3's glprogs/ directory
   (maybe one of the GLSL implementations + shaders could be improved to achieve that)

 * Music is missing, http://dnbradio.com/player is our choice :)
 
 * Key binding are missing in GUI. Not tricky at all, but tedious
 
 * HD pack is not ready yet (TGA textures instead of DDS compressed ones)
 
 * Substances, .blend files and original (RAW) images will be available, maybe on some FTP server later
 
 * Not all of the content was merged from private SVN yet
