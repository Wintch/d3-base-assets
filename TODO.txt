 * Some models and most animations
 
 * A lot of bug fixing/testing is required
 
 * Working dedicated server
 
 * DPmaster will be developed in separate project
 
 * OpenGL Shaders to replace the stuff from Doom3's glprogs/ directory
   (maybe one of the GLSL implementations + shaders could be improved)

 * Music is missing, listen to http://dnbradio.com instead :)
