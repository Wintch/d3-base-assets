	Assets

 * Connecting to LAN server is a bit tricky, make sure you are selecting the server. Use console when possible
 * Some assets are missing (were not rewritten or merged yet)
 * Grenades decals sometimes are not shown
 * shotgun_muzzleflash is not working as it should
 * Game may refuse tu run (tested on MAC). Lowering the resolution with r_mode 0 fixes that, but better default is needed

	Engine

 * fx's are not played client-side, may be related to PVS (you will see many effects only if you are the server of that game)
 * LAG can and will make playing DM5 painful
 * On some intel video-cards you may have troubles with shadows. Just turn them off in that case
 * Latin American keyboard layout disables the console usage
 * Dedicated server is not working properly. Only listen servers are fine at the moment

	Undefined

 * Serverlist on LAN search is only visible for some time, use the console to see the scanned IPs and "connect IP" to any
 * Lagometer is not working (can't be enabled on client site)
